        <h2>Album Art</h2>
        <p>
          Riley is a local recording artist in Bakersfield. His first EP titled
          "Chasing Ghosts" features art inspired by classic the 32bit games of
          the 90's. Pixelated in Photoshop we began with sketches of Riley as
          simplified and retro as possible. We visioned the character as a
          modern link wielding a guitar around chasing ghosts, a metaphor for
          content in the album. You can stream Chasing Ghosts on{" "}
