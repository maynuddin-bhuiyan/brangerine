        <h2>Logo design </h2>
        <p>
          The client wanted a face of a pirate that was bold and would look well
          as a stand alone symbol. We started with sketched out concepts of the
          logo and text. The client was interested in keeping a pirate feel with
          the type as well. Blackbeard pools is a pool cleaning service
          currently looking to expand in other markets.
