        First and foremost if you are reading this thank you, I feel for you and
        your family. I understand how this pandemic situation has turned our
        daily routines into utter chaos, but it doesn’t have to be that way.{" "}

        My day job for those that don’t know is in the remodeling space, we do
        windows, kitchens & bath rooms. Coming into a strangers home with a
        mask. Hand sanitizer and a UV sanitizing wand is new norm but the job
        has been relatively the same. It’s the conversations I’ve had with these
        families that I’d like to share with you today.

        Here are 10 tips to make working from home more efficient and enjoyable.

      <div className={styles.DetailsBodyText}>
        <p>
          1. <span className={styles.title}>Routine.</span> It may seem as a no
          brainer to some, but for others having trouble working from home, this
          can be the difference between actually getting the work done or not.
          Don’t have to be a robot but structure your day a little to work
          smarter not harder. Check out{" "}

          2. <span className={styles.title}>Set Daily Tasks/Goals.</span> I’d
          recommend setting daily goals for whenever you work but especially
          while working from home. Distractions are all around when you are
          home; the laundry, dishes, TV, etc. Having goals that are in place for
          the day will help you stay on task.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. <span className={styles.title}>Get Out.</span> Practice social
          distancing while getting out of the house. Chances are there is an
          entire ecosystem in your backyard no matter the appearance, exploring
          your nearest neighbors can be enjoyable and has been proven to reduce
          depression. Take a walk, for me it’s a bike ride or grabbing my
          skateboard for a ride around the block.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. <span className={styles.title}>Stretch.</span> Get the blood
          flowing, muscles limber, you can stretch while you’re on a call.

          5. <span className={styles.title}> Be Thankful.</span> I’ve talked to
          a few families in the recent and this tip has come directly from them.
          Understanding that others have lost their jobs it’s imperative to be
          thankful for what you do have. Things could be worse. Wake up with
          purpose and take on the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. <span className={styles.title}> Vent.</span> Not to take away from
          number five at all but one thing I learned while selling Cutco knives
          in college was the 5 minute rule. You are welcome to vent to your
          partner/ coworker for 5 minutes anything past that you’re just soaking
          the energy out of the both of you. Life happens get the anger out and
          back to being proactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. <span className={styles.title}> Accountability/Support.</span> I’m
          a huge believer of team work makes the dream work. Having a partner in
          your corner works wonders. An accountability partner is a person who
          coaches another person in terms of helping the other person keep a
          commitment. Currently Justin over at{" "}

          8.<span className={styles.title}> Dress The Part.</span> I’m guilty of
          wearing pj’s below the waist and button ups about the waist line on a
          zoom call for sure! Haha. But there’s something about looking good
          before you work that I believe gives your day a little extra in the
          ordinary. When you feel good you do good.{" "}

          9.<span className={styles.title}> Be Present.</span> If you take
          anything from these tips I’d say this is the most important. It goes
          without saying that time sure does fly and whether things adjust in a
          few weeks or a few months, being present with your actions can really
          be impactful. Enjoy life and enjoy the time you have with others
          always
        </p>
        <p>
          10.<span className={styles.title}> Stay Organized/ Clean.</span> I
          don’t mean get distracted with the dishes, laundry and all that but
          clean your work area a bit. I’m all about efficiency and a minute
          spent planning/ organizing can save you hours on the back end.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.<span className={styles.title}> Bonus.</span> When you are out
          running errands please don’t wear gloves, they are quite useless, a
          mask and washing your hands is fine enough. I carry a UV wand to
          sterilize my mask daily. If you happen to see gloves on the flood pick
          them up and throw them away.{" "}
