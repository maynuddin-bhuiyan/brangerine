        ECOSYSTEM: A BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY OF INTERACTING ORGANISMS AND THEIR
        PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT.

      <p className={styles.text}>
        Maybe this whole time, we've been asking ourselves the wrong question:
      </p>
      <p className={`${styles.text} ${styles.quote}`}>
        "How do I find the right people?"
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Having the right team is crucial to success in business. More
        importantly, having a proper ecosystem breeds replication. In this
        article, we will discuss why having the right people running your
        business can make all the difference.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Let's take it from the top, shall we? Or, the bottom, rather. Let's
        dissect your business from the roots and see what we can dig up.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Many businesses find themselves in a purgatory between stagnating and
        breaking barriers. Some are losing money every day while others are in a
        place where productivity is electric. But remember, even if you're
        standing on top of a mountain, the earth is still 238,900 miles away
        from the moon. (yes, I googled it)
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Speaking of the $527 billion giant, (googled that, too) how does an idea
        turn into the world's second largest company? What manifested the
        concept?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Aside from technology - which we'll get to later - people are the
        driving force behind a successful company. Let's look at a two part
        concept of an ecosystem:
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>Biology + Environment</p>
      <p className={`${styles.text} ${styles.quote}`}>
        - "Jellyfish have been proven to be the most energy efficient swimmers
        of all animals."{" "}
      </p>
      <p className={`${styles.text} ${styles.quote}`}>
        - "Jellyfish lifespans typically range from a few hours (in the case of
        some very small hydromedusae) to several months; there are some
        indications that deep sea species may live on the order of years."{" "}
      </p>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>BIOLOGY</h1>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        What kind of people do you want on your team?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Are they energy efficient, but maintain a short life span?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>Are they spineless and reckless?</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>Are they fearless, yet tactful?</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        What is more important to you, intellectual nature or proactive nature?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>Are they master communicators?</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>Do you want sheep or lions?</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>How many hunters do you need?</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        And they can't all hunt, someone must tend to the village, so who are
        your homemakers?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Here's a tough question: WHAT DOES THEIR LEADER LOOK LIKE?
      </p>
      <p className={`${styles.text} ${styles.spacing}`}>THAT'S YOU!!</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        I hope you can answer that question without hesitation. Did you notice
        how none of those questions asked about a person's resume? Now,
        understand that experience and qualifications are essential, but not the
        most important part.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        These organisms that interact and work together on a daily basis are all
        part of the ecosystem. As business owners, we need a clear vision for
        the type of people we need. This is about culture.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        If you are a restaurant looking for expansion and leadership, then it
        doesn't matter what grades a person got in college. It's irrelevant when
        the pressure is insurmountable and you need a lion instead of a parrot.
        The kid with something to prove to himself will outwork the one who's
        trying to prove something to others.

      <p className={styles.text}>
        Let's change lenses for a second to get a different view. If you are a
        technology-based company, then maybe now, we weigh data set and
        knowledge a little heavier. A brain that can scale numbers and formulas
        is a great tool for productivity.

      <p className={styles.text}>What kind of resources does your team have?</p>

        Are they doing things the old fashioned way on pen and paper or using
        Macbooks and apps?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        What environment is necessary, old and rustic for effect?

      <p className={styles.text}>Is your team hungry all the time?</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Do they stare at the clock all day waiting to get off, or do they stick

        If you take nothing else away from this article, then at least chew on
        this one: you can motivate almost any "millenial" with food and a

        We are a rare species that has evolved from the depths of elderly
        skepticism, predicated on the assumption of status-quo as an
        end-all-be-all format for societal acceptance. We are a paradoxical
        organism. On one hand, we eat organic and lean. On the other, we will
        take a whole pizza to the face. One day we're hitting the gym and taking
        care of our health, the next we're destroying it with a few nights out.
        And our body is 63.5% coffee.

        All jokes aside, it isn't impossible to meet your people where they want
        to be met. We could spend all day discussing what it means to establish
        the right ecosystem, but understand that culture creates consistency. A
        predetermined ecosystem, before someone is hired, will communicate
        proper expectations. You now have a living and breathing mission
        statement/ mantra/ motto.

        - "Jellyfish adversely affect humanity by interfering with public
        systems and harming swimmers. The most obvious consequences are human
        injury or death and reduced coastal tourism. Jellies destroy fish nets,
        poison or crush captured fish, and consume fish eggs and young fish. The
        most venomous jellyfish is the box jellyfish which produces enough
        poison to kill 60 humans and is the reason for 1 death per year."
