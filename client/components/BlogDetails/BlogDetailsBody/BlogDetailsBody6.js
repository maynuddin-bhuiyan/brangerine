      <p>
        The open sign is lit, it's a nice day out, and you have specials going
        on and it's empty. What's going on? If you have been there more times
        than you can remember, stay calm. Also keep in mind that a business
        failing is still a business, in business. However, you do need to{" "}

      <h1 className={styles.title}>1. LACK OF EFFECTIVE MARKETING</h1>
      <p>
        The biggest opportunity you have to change is marketing. Not every
        business owner is a natural born marketing pro. In fact we've come to
        find out that the know it alls actually don't know much. When you have
        jobs on the line, and your business is in jeopardy. Somebody has to take
        action. Yes marketing is absolutely an investment in time and money.
        Being decisive about making that investment will reap you the reward in
        the long run.
      </p>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>2. YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC</h1>
      <p>
        This is critical because how else do you present a solution for a
        problem if you don't know your demographics problem. How do you show
        them they have a problem if you don't know who they even are? Think of
        an ice-cream man, he drives through the streets knowing kids are out
        playing and their parents with their wallets are nearby. The point is
        you may be that ice-cream man driving down the business district rather
        than the neighborhood.
      </p>
      <h1 className={styles.title}> 3. GET WITH THE TIMES</h1>
      <p>
        Things are heading in a new light and thats social media. If your
        company is not active on various outlets then you are doing damage to
        your company and to your image. There should be a strategy in place for
        your online social campaigns. Don't be that company that talks about
        themselves all the time. Or that company trying to get "likes" saying
        pointless things to stay active. It's more of a hub, full of people that
        recognize your company and want to follow it. Give them content worth
        following.
      </p>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>4. KNOW YOUR MARGINS </h1>
      <p>
        If you are busy with more work than you can handle but you can't seem to
        pay the bills or your staff than you have a pricing issue. Pricing{" "}

        cost of operations. Internet service, heating/cooling cost, salary, cost
